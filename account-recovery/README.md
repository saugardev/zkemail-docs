# Account Recovery

Account recovery allows you to use email addresses to recover Ethereum smart wallets. It uses ZK Email under the hood to verify the email replies and trigger account recovery. We provide several tools, including the [Ether Email-Auth](https://github.com/zkemail/ether-email-auth/tree/feat/docs-updates) SDK that lets you define any new email-triggered smart contracts directly via Solidity, and our audited Account Recovery [7579](https://erc7579.com/)-compatible module for generic smart wallets. You can try our account recovery demo at [prove.email/recovery](https://prove.email/recovery) and read about it at [prove.email/blog/recovery](https://prove.email/blog/recovery).
