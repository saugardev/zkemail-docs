# ZK Email SDK

The ZK Email SDK is a tool that allows developers to create zero-knowledge proofs for email verification with minimal code. It's designed to simplify the process of implementing privacy-preserving email authentication in various applications.

At its core, the ZK Email SDK enables you to:

1. Generate zero-knowledge proofs from email content.
2. Verify these proofs without revealing sensitive email data.
3. Integrate email-based authentication into blockchain applications.

## How It Works

The ZK Email SDK operates on a few key principles:

1. **Email Parsing**: The SDK extracts relevant information from emails, such as sender, recipient, subject, and specific content patterns.
2. **Proof Generation**: Using the extracted information, the SDK generates a zero-knowledge proof. This proof demonstrates the validity of certain claims about the email without revealing the email's contents.
3. **Verification**: The generated proof can be verified by anyone without access to the original email, ensuring privacy while confirming the authenticity of the claims.
4. **Integration**: The SDK provides easy-to-use interfaces for integrating these proofs into your applications, whether they're web apps, smart contracts, or other systems.
